Build a PWA called Shuffle 7 — a mindset support app with a daily card draw and monthly lifelines.
Create a static frontend (HTML/CSS/JS, no build tools). Use localStorage for state. Ship as an installable PWA with offline support.

Requirements

Pages & UI

Header with app name + short disclaimer (mindset support only; not prophecy; never harmful/selfish).

Main area with a 3D CSS carousel ring of card backs that auto-rotates. Tapping/clicking stops the carousel.

Two buttons:

“Draw Today’s Card” (once per day; show same card if revisiting that day)

“Lifeline (X left)” (up to 5 per month)

Result view shows: card image, category, short message, and a “Back to Carousel” button.

Data

cards.json with 7 categories: Wisdom, Health, Challenge, Leadership, Tongue N Cheek, Possibilities, Knowledge.

Each entry has { "category", "image", "message" }. Use placeholder images from /assets.

State rules

Daily draw lock (keyed by YYYY-MM-DD).

Lifeline usage tracked per month (max 5; resets each new month).

Persist via localStorage.

PWA

manifest.webmanifest with name, theme, icons.

sw.js caching: index.html, style.css, script.js, cards.json, icons, and card-back placeholder.

Register service worker in script.js. App should work offline after first load.

Styling/Animation

Modern, dark UI.

CSS 3D ring: 10 panels around a circle using transform: rotateY(calc(var(--i)*angle)) translateZ(...).

Spinning class via @keyframes rotateY; toggle spin on stage click.

Create this file structure and fill with working starter code (minimal but functional):

index.html – layout, buttons, result section, includes style.css, script.js, manifest link, meta theme color.

style.css – dark theme, centered layout, carousel/ring styles, flip animation for reveal.

script.js – load cards.json, implement daily draw + lifeline logic with localStorage, toggle views, ring spin toggle, SW registration.

cards.json – 7 starter cards with category, placeholder image paths (assets/wisdom.png, assets/health.png, assets/challenge.png, assets/leadership.png, assets/tongue.png, assets/possibilities.png, assets/knowledge.png).

manifest.webmanifest – PWA config, icons.

sw.js – cache-first service worker with version bump for updates.

/assets/ – add placeholders:
